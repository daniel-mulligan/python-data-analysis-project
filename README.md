# ðŸŽ“ Exam Data Analysis with Python

This project simulates, cleans, analyzes, and visualizes examination data for a tertiary institution. Using Python, it generates **two realistic datasets** and applies statistical analysis to uncover patterns in student performance, study habits, and demographics.

## ðŸ“¦ Project Overview

This project covers:

- Simulated exam data generation (2 datasets)  
- Data cleaning and augmentation  
- Frequency analysis using Pandas  
- Visualization with Matplotlib  
- Insightful interpretation of each datasetâ€™s patterns  
- Final conclusions drawn from comparison of both datasets

for a more detailed overview please view: [Project Overview](docs/project-overview.md)

## ðŸ§° Tools & Environment

- **IDE:** Spyder 5.5.1 (Anaconda)  
- **Python Version:** 3.12.7 (64-bit)  
- **Libraries Used:**  
  - `Pandas`  
  - `Matplotlib`  
  - `NumPy`  

- **Operating System:** Windows 11

## ðŸ“Š Features & Visuals

The project includes the following visualizations:

1. **Bar Chart** â€“ Student age groups  
2. **Line Graph** â€“ Time studied vs. mark achieved  
3. **Scatter Plot** â€“ Mark achieved vs. exam duration  
4. **Scatter Plot** â€“ Age vs. study time

Each visualization was produced for **both datasets**, allowing cross-comparison and deeper insight.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. 	open csv_gen.py and run it to generate the CSV file.

2. 	Open csv_clean.py and run it to clean the data in the previous csv file.
	(NB: make sure that the csv is in the same file as this .py file)

3. 	Open ft_graphs and run it to produce the frequency tables, graphs and charts
	(viewable on Spyder plot view)

Install dependencies if needed:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib
```

## ðŸ“Œ Key Insights

* Students aged 25â€“35 are most common in both datasets.

* There's a positive correlation between study hours and exam marks.

* A slight negative correlation exists between time taken on the exam and the final score.

* Older students generally study more, suggesting experience or discipline.

* Dataset comparison helps verify consistency of trends across different student samples.
