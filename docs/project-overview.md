# ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

## ðŸŽ“ Introduction

This project focuses on capturing and analyzing data from examinations conducted by a large tertiary institution. The goal is to generate a `.csv` file containing simulated student exam data and provide a well-structured analytical report with key insights.

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives

- Simulate realistic exam-related data using Python.
- Research statistical trends commonly found in tertiary education exams.
- Refine the data to ensure it reflects plausible academic performance and behavioral patterns.

## ðŸ”§ Approach

1. **Data Generation**  
   A general method is outlined to generate data that aligns with expected distributions (age, study time, exam marks, etc.).

2. **Statistical Refinement**  
   The generated data is fine-tuned based on researched averages and trends, ensuring the data mimics real-world academic performance.

3. **Data Binning & Analysis**  
   Using the **Pandas** library, the data is grouped into bins to create frequency tables for better interpretability.

4. **Visualization**  
   The following charts and graphs are created using **Matplotlib**:
   - ðŸ“Š **Bar Chart**: Distribution of students across different age groups.
   - ðŸ“ˆ **Line Graph**: Correlation between hours studied and marks achieved.
   - ðŸ”µ **Scatter Plot 1**: Correlation between exam mark and duration taken to complete the exam.
   - ðŸŸ  **Scatter Plot 2**: Correlation between student age and time spent studying on campus.

5. **Interpretation**  
   Insights are drawn from each graph individually, followed by combined conclusions to understand trends across the entire dataset.

## ðŸ§  Outcome

By the end of this project, the institution will have a clearer picture of:
- Which student groups are performing better
- How study habits affect performance
- Patterns related to exam duration and age demographics

This project simulates **two datasets** to confirm consistency in observed patterns, offering a robust foundation for future institutional decisions.
