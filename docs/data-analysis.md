# 📊 Data Analysis and Insights

This section presents the findings from two generated datasets and the conclusions drawn from multiple visualizations and frequency tables.

## 🎓 Student Ages (Frequency Tables & Bar Charts)

### Dataset 1 – Conclusion:
Most students fall within the **25–35 age range**, while significantly fewer are between **18–25**. This indicates that many students begin their tertiary education a few years after finishing high school. Additionally, the number of students over **45** surpasses that of the youngest group, suggesting a declining interest in tertiary education among recent school-leavers.

### Dataset 2 – Conclusion:
The second dataset supports the same conclusion: very few students are in the 18–25 bracket. This trend might reflect either a waning interest in higher education among younger individuals or external factors such as:
- Negative population growth in the university’s catchment area.
- The institution's academic offerings or learning mode deterring younger students.

## ⏱️ Average Hours Studied (Frequency Tables)

![Dataset 1](/images/freq-hours-1.png) 

![Dataset 2](/images/freq-hours-2.png) 

### Dataset 1 & 2 – Conclusion:
Both datasets show that **2–3 hours** is the most common study duration before an exam. This may suggest that this duration is perceived as effective — though this will be examined further in the mark correlation.

Interestingly, **4–5 hours** had the lowest number of students, potentially indicating:
- Lack of discipline among those studying only 2–3 hours.
- Misjudgment of how much time is required to succeed.

## 📝 Student Marks (Frequency Tables)

![Dataset 2](/images/freq-marks-2.png) 

### Dataset 1 & 2 – Conclusion:
In both datasets, **over half of the students scored below 50%**:
- **Dataset 1**: 82 out of 150 students failed.
- **Dataset 2**: 84 out of 150 students failed.

This suggests potential issues with:
- The university's ability to support its students.
- Or exams being disproportionately difficult relative to student preparedness.

## 📈 Correlation: Study Hours vs. Exam Marks (Line Graph)

![Dataset 1](/images/mark-study-time.png) 

![Dataset 2](/images/mark-study-time-2.png) 

### Dataset 1 & 2 – Conclusion:
- **4–5 hours of study** resulted in the highest marks.
- In **Dataset 1**, students studying **2–3 hours** outperformed those who studied 1–2 hours — but only slightly.
- In **Dataset 2**, the opposite occurred — students who studied **1–2 hours** outperformed the 2–3 hour group.

These results may indicate:
- Students studying 2–3 hours may not study effectively or cover enough content.
- Those studying 1–2 hours may grasp concepts faster or rely on prior knowledge.

## 📉 Correlation: Exam Duration vs. Exam Marks (Scatter Plot)

![Dataset 1](/images/mark-exam-time.png) 

![Dataset 2](/images/mark-exam-time-2.png) 

### Dataset 1 & 2 – Conclusion:
- No strong correlation was found between **time spent writing** and **marks achieved**.
- However, students who completed the exam in **under 1 hour** scored significantly better than those who took **160–180 minutes**.

This suggests a **slight negative correlation** between time taken and performance — particularly at the extremes.

## 📚 Correlation: Study Time vs. Student Age (Scatter Plot)

![Dataset 1](/images/studytime-studentage.png) 

![Dataset 2](/images/studytime-studentage-2.png) 

### Dataset 1 & 2 – Conclusion:
There’s a clear trend showing that **older students study more**:
- In **Dataset 1**, only **one student under 20** studied more than 1.5 hours.
- In **Dataset 2**, **no student under 30** studied less than 1.5 hours.

Possible reasons:
- Older students may use more structured study methods.
- Younger students may under-report study time or rely more on alternative learning formats like videos or flashcards.

## 🧠 Final Conclusions

From the combined analysis of both datasets, the key issues are:

### 🚨 Major Concern:
- **Very low enrollment or participation from students aged 18–25**.
    - Recommendation: The university should compare its enrollment trends with nearby institutions to determine whether this is a localized issue or part of a broader generational shift.

### ⚠️ Additional Concerns:
- **Over 50% failure rate** on exams.
    - Possible causes: Lack of academic support or misaligned difficulty levels.
- **Short study duration** for most students.
    - Suggestion: Require students to log **a minimum of 4 hours of study** prior to final exams.
    - Implement additional **mock exams** to monitor student preparedness.

These insights aim to assist the university in enhancing both academic outcomes and student engagement strategies.
